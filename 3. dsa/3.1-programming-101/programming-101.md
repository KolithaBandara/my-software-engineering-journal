# Programming 101

### 1. Printing "Hello World!"
1st we're gonna talk about the basic thing in programming. I mean the "Hello World!" program. We are learning DSA with JavaScript. So, we have to try that "Hello World!" program with JavaScript.

Open your console and type;
`console.log("Hello World!")`. 
Then run the code.

You can see an output like **Hello World!** on your console.

### 2. Data Types
In the programming world we can see so many data types. In here we are learning them with JavaScript. So, we have to talk about the data types what related to the JavaScript.
1. String 
2. Numbers
3. NuN
4. Boolean

### 3. Variable Types
In JavaScript we can see 3 variable types. Like this;
1. var
2. let
3. const

Using those variable types, you can store values inside of variables.

### 4. String Concatenation
You can concat strings in JavaScript too.

    let firstName = "Dean";
    let lastName = "Winchester";

    let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
    
    console.log(fullName)

& the output will be like `Dean Winchester`.

### 5. If you run a JavaScript code
JavaScript needs to use JavaScript engine for it. That means, JavaScript is using "execution context" for that.

### 6. Arrays
In JavaScript you can create arrays with including what you want. I mean, you can add any data type what you want.
Like this;
1. Numbers
2. Strings

Ex:-
    
        let arr = ["Dean", "Sam", "John", "Mary"]
